    The major challenge these days with the increased usage of the mobile phone is
    loss of sleep, and threat to mental wellness. Sleep time is meant for the brain
    to rejuvenate. If the sleep patterns are disturbed due to a continuous external
    disturbance, it is most likely to disturb the deep sleep. It is wise to
    switch-off the music after the person sleeps which most of us do not do as we
    are already slept by then. Many researches convey that music is a solution to
    reduce stress and to bring sleep. But, we are using headphones for music and
    it causes side-effects including affecting sleep and noise induced hearing loss
    (NIHL). Here, we propose a system which will ensure that the music player is
    stopped after understanding that the person using it has slept and he no more
    needs the tunes thereby not disturbing the sleep and preventing insomnia/NIHL.

    In most countries, vegetables, fruits, or any edible material (could be a
    raw material as well) is cultivated in one place and circulated to all the
    other places in the country through various modes of transport. For example,
    most of the vegetables are from Coimbatore and other parts of Tamilnadu are
    cultivated and circulated from Ooty through truck, lorries and other modes
    of transports. It is eventually understandable that, the transports of
    vegetables happen from one place to another and the same gets distributed
    to further interior places. In the process, the order in which the
    vegetables are stacked in the order in which the vegetables are stacked out.
    The first placed vegetable basket is the last one to go out; by the time it
    goes out, it could have already been spoiled and could be unusable. Also,
    there could be some vegetables that could withstand much more time inside
    the transport vehicle. Our innovation is aimed at identifying the vegetable
    basket that is most likely to be spoiled and delivering it earlier in order
    to reduce the chance that it arrives spoiled.
