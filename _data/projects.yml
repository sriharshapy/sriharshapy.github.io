  venue: Research, Summer 2024
  description: >-
    Using llava-1.5-7b-hf 7 billion params multi modal, I fine tuned it into a
    chat instruction model. The dataset contains both images and text.
    GPU Nvidia A100 on google colab was used to fine tune this model with Lora
    technique. To enhance the training speed and reduce compute the model is
    4 bit quantized.

  title: "Pre training vs Fine tuning"
  venue: Research Spring, 2024
  description: >-
    This study examines the performance of various deep learning models on a
    small, custom dataset of 1,800 images across six categories. We compare the
    efficacy of training models from scratch against using fine tuned pretrained
    architectures, specifically ResNet-18, VGG-19, and Inception V3. Our results
    suggest that fine tuned models of pretrained architectures significantly
    outperform models trained from scratch, offering better accuracy with
    less computational expense, particularly in data-constrained environments.
    The implications of these findings advocate for the strategic use of
    transfer learning in similar small-scale data settings.
